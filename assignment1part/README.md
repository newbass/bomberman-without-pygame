					|| BOMBERMAN GAME ||

==> Start the game by typing python3 wall.py.
==> A typical version of graphic-less bomberman was made as a part of the SSAD Assignment 1.
==> Basic controls:
	'a': Bomberman moves left
	'w': Bomberman moves up
	's': Bomberman moves down
	'd': Bomberman moves right
	'b': Bomberman drops the bomb
	'q': To quit the game, which we won't appreciate until you get to level 3.
==> This game has 3 levels each of which has its own difficulties.
==> With each of the passing levels, the number of enemies will increase and the number
of bricks also increase, which means? You have higher chances of being killed.
==> All the elements have been given a colors code.
	--The outer wall has a white color with no specific symbols.
	--The inner wall has a '#' symbol in white.
	--The bricks which fetch you 20 points are colored purple with symbol '/', which is the only
	way to gain confidence and show your purple patch in the world of bombs.
	--The bomberman or the hero of the game is colored green and has 3 lives per level, is denoted
	by 'B'
	--The enemies, your villian in the game are colored red and are symboled 'E'.
	--The dropped bomb will be colored blue.
	--The explosion will be symboled 'e' and will be colored yellow.
==> The bomberman can drop the bomb at any place where he can visit.
==> After the bomb has been dropped, you have exactly 3 frames to kill the enemy or break the brick.
==> Use your keypresses with extreme caution, because presses win matches.
==> A hint for all the players is to hit a boundary when you drop the bomb.
Don't get it right? Show how smart you are!
==> A timer will also be showed after you plant the bomb, like it will show the number of frames left
for the bomb to explode.
==> The score of the hero and the lives he has left to complete the level will be showed in the
bottom left corner of the gaming arena.
==> If you come in the way of the enemy, the enemy has got plans for you. You will be swooshed! Beware.
==> Your speed and the enemy's speed is the same. We believe in equality.
==> The enemy is smart, it will try to run away from the bomb if you aren't equally smart.
==> After you cross a level, the scores get nullified and lives get back.
